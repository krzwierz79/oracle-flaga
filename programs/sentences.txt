The Yellow Wallpaper
By Charlotte Perkins Gilman

It is very seldom that mere ordinary people like John and myself secure
ancestral halls for the summer.
-----------------------


A colonial mansion, a hereditary estate, I would say a haunted house,
and reach the height of romantic felicity—but that would be asking too
much of fate!
-----------------------


Still I will proudly declare that there is something queer about it.
-----------------------


Else, why should it be let so cheaply?
-----------------------

 And why have stood so long
untenanted?
-----------------------


John laughs at me, of course, but one expects that in marriage.
-----------------------


John is practical in the extreme.
-----------------------

 He has no patience with faith, an
intense horror of superstition, and he scoffs openly at any talk of
things not to be felt and seen and put down in figures.
-----------------------


John is a physician, and perhaps—(I would not say it to a living soul,
of course, but this is dead paper and a great relief to my
mind)—perhaps that is one reason I do not get well faster.
-----------------------


You see, he does not believe I am sick!
